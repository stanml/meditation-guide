        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Elizabeth English (b.1963). I teach mindfulness and meditation at Cambridge University. I have the incredible privilege of being Cambridge Universityâ€™s first Mindfulness Practitioner. My mindfulness courses were the subject of an extensive research trial that showed the significant benefit of mindfulness to students (published in The Lancet PH, December 2017).
          I draw on four decades of personal meditation practice as well as my Masters and Doctorate degrees sudying Buddhist meditation texts, at Oxford University.
          I am a certified teacher of Mindfulness, Focusing, Somatic Experiencing and Nonviolent Communication.
          I live in Cambridge with my partner and my cocker spaniel, Cherub.
